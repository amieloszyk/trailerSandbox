This is a code to try making rigid bodies that can be used to evaluate the motion
of bodies (*e.g.*, trailer movement behind a truck). It is also an opportunity
for me to try and code up an attainable project quickly.

**First requirements:**
* Make a class to transform coordinates into a local coordinate system in 2D with rotation
* Create series of equations to control the motion of points (*e.g.*, translation and rotation)
* Be able to link the motion of points to one another
